BrokeBuzz - get buzzed, efficiently.
www.BrokeBuzz.com


BrokeBuzz is a fun project that I put together to improve upon and demonstrate my rails ability.  The idea behind BrokeBuzz is to enable users to search for beer, wine, or liquor, and after making a few additional inputs, determine which selection will most efficiently get them buzzed (based off the lowest price per pure ounce of alcohol).  Several items I focused on including in this project were:
  - use of HTTParty gem to connect with BreweryDB and Wine.com APIs for wine & beer searches
  - rails conventions like restful routes, div_for, and form helpers
  - before save / after save functionality in the Items model
  - continuous integration and deployment to Heroku through circle CI
  - background animation on scroll
  - single page applicaton
