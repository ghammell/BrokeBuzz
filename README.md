<h1>BrokeBuzz - get buzzed, efficiently.</h1>
www.BrokeBuzz.com


<p>BrokeBuzz is a fun project that I put together to improve upon and demonstrate my rails ability.  The idea behind BrokeBuzz is to enable users to search for beer, wine, or liquor, and after making a few additional inputs, determine which selection will most efficiently get them buzzed (based off the lowest price per pure ounce of alcohol).  Several items I focused on including in this project were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use of HTTParty gem to connect with BreweryDB and Wine.com APIs for wine & beer searches </li>
  <li>rails conventions like restful routes, div_for, and form helpers</li>
  <li>before save / after save functionality in the Items model</li>
  <li>continuous integration and deployment to Heroku through circle CI</li>
  <li>randomly generated, dynamic background</li>
  <li>single page applicaton</li>
  <li>rspec testing</li>
</ul>
